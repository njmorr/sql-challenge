# sql-challenge
This sql database consists of six tables:
* departments
* dept_emp
* dept_manager
* employees
* salaries
* titles

The ERD graphic depicts the relationship between these tables.  Both the schemata and the queries are contained in the sql-challenge.sql file.

This is in fact, a fictions database! :)

After importing the sql database via slqalchemy into a dataframe and the plotting the histogram, there is a disproportionate number of employees with a salary of $40k/yr.

Also, nice easter egg with the April Foolsday alias!
